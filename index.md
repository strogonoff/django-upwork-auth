Simple Upwork login for your app. Tested with Django 1.8 (see example project).

Before oDesk rebranded as Upwork, this library was called django-odesk-auth.
The latest version of django-odesk-auth works with Upwork already.
This library is not backwards compatible with django-odesk-auth.


## Creating Upwork OAuth API key

Go to https://www.upwork.com/services/api/apply.

* Authentication type should be set to "OAuth 1.0".
* Callback URL should be left blank.
* Default authentication backend requires
  "View the structure of your companies/teams" permission to be checked.


## Adding Upwork auth to your Django project

Make sure you have ``django-upwork-auth`` and ``python-upwork==1.0`` installed.
Make sure you have Django's ``sites`` and ``session`` frameworks enabled.

1. Add ``'django_upwork_auth'`` to ``INSTALLED_APPS``.

2. Add ``'django_upwork_auth.backends.UpworkOAuthBackend'``
   to AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS.

3. Specify ``UPWORK_OAUTH_KEY`` and ``UPWORK_OAUTH_SECRET`` settings
   with your key information.

4. Add ``'your_upwork_username'`` to ``UPWORK_AUTH_ALLOWED_USERS``,
   and set ``UPWORK_AUTH_AUTO_CREATE_USERS`` to True.

5. Include ``django_upwork_auth.urls`` in your URL patterns.

6. In your login page template, put a link (say, "Log in via Upwork")
   and point it to {% raw %}``{% url "upwork_oauth_login" %}``{% endraw %}.

7. Open login page and click "Log in via Upwork" to verify everything works.

NOTE:
Keep ``UPWORK_OAUTH_KEY`` and ``UPWORK_OAUTH_SECRET`` settings
in a file that is not under version control. One way to do that:

* Keep public settings in a versioned file ``settings_base.py``
* Keep private settings in ``settings.py``
* In the beginning of ``settings.py``, have ``from settings_base import *``


## Example project

Requirements: Vagrant, Ansible, and free 8000 port.

First, fill in the necessary settings in ``example_project/settings.py``
(see comments in the file).

From ``example_project`` directory, bring up a virtual machine
using the Vagrantfile provided, and manually run Django development server inside:

    $ vagrant up
    $ vagrant ssh
    vm$ cd /vagrant/example_project/
    vm$ ./manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000

On your host machine, navigate to 127.0.0.1:8000 where you should be able
to test Upwork login functionality in action.


## Authentication backend

Stock authentication backend assumes that you only use Upwork login in your app.
When someone logs in, if their Upwork ID matches existing username, it logs
them in as that user. If there's no username matching given Upwork ID, it optionally
creates a user with such username.

**IMPORTANT:**
If you are using other authentication methods
in addition to Upwork OAuth, or if there’s any other reason
one end user’s Upwork ID can match another’s ``User.username``,
you *must* subclass ``backends.UpworkOAuthBackend`` and override
some of its methods.

Stock authentication backend provides optional basic access control facilities.
You can specify who is allowed to log in to your site and who upon login gets
staff and/or superuser statuses. This is configured through Django settings.

If whitelisting is on and given user is not on the white list, their
``User.is_active`` flag gets set to False upon login.

**IMPORTANT:**
By default authentication backend lets anyone log in via Upwork.

See below all settings provided by stock authentication backend.

You can subclass stock authentication backend to override user manipulation
(see ``handle_unknown_user()`` and ``update_user()`` methods).


## Making authenticated Upwork API calls

After user is successfully authenticated you can call Upwork API on their behalf.
For that you'd need the access token obtained during OAuth flow.

By default this app uses Django's built-in session framework to store
access token. The key it uses can be retrieved from
``django_upwork_auth.settings.ACCESS_TOKEN_SESSION_KEY``
and customized via ``UPWORK_OAUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN_SESSION_KEY`` setting.

Example code you can have in your view::

```python
from django_upwork_auth import utils, settings

upwork_client = utils.get_client(
    request.session[settings.ACCESS_TOKEN_SESSION_KEY])

print upwork_client.hr.get_teams()
# Should output list of teamrooms current user belongs to
```

You can use another storage technique by overriding
``UPWORK_OAUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN_STORE_FUNC``. It's useful if you need to make Upwork API call
but can't easily read user's session because there's no request context.
For example, you can store access token with associated username in Redis
and query it in your asynchronous tasks.

Note:

* How you make API calls is up to you. Internally django-upwork-auth
  uses python-upwork library, and so does the above example.

* ``utils.get_client()`` function returns an instance of ``upwork.Client``.
  Handy if you're using python-upwork library to make API calls.


## Verifying OAuth access token

If you want to periodically check whether current user's authentication
is still valid, this Django app provides a helper for that:
``utils.check_login()``.

It can be used in a view like this:

```python

from django_upwork_auth import utils

def oauth_check_login(request):
    u"""Verifies OAuth access token and user status on Upwork.
    Returns HTTP 200 (OK) or HTTP 401 (Unauthorized)
    with additional information in response body text.
    """
    access_token = utils.access_token.get(request)

    if access_token is None or len(access_token) != 2:
        return http.HttpResponse(
            u"Bad or missing Upwork OAuth access token", status=401)

    result, details = utils.check_login(access_token)

    if result is True:
        return http.HttpResponse(details, status=200)
    else:
        return http.HttpResponse(details, status=401)
```


## Important Django settings

UPWORK_OAUTH_KEY, UPWORK_OAUTH_SECRET
  API key information.

UPWORK_AUTH_LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL = settings.LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL
  Where to redirect the user at the end of OAuth flow.
  Path or URL pattern name.

UPWORK_AUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN_STORE_FUNC
  Function to be called to store OAuth access token for future access.
  It's passed two arguments: a request where user is already
  authenticated and the access token associated with that user.
  Default implementation stores token in session under ``ACCESS_TOKEN_SESSION_KEY``.


### Settings specific to stock backend

``backends.UpworkOAuthBackend`` and override some of its logic.

UPWORK_AUTH_AUTO_CREATE_USERS = False

  for the first time (i.e., ID returned by Upwork is free in your Django DB).

UPWORK_AUTH_WHITELIST = ()  
  Upwork IDs of users who are allowed to log in via Upwork.

UPWORK_AUTH_STAFF_WHITELIST = ()
